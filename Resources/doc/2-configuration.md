``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
scribe_pheanstalk:
    enabled: true
    pheanstalks:
        primary:
            server: beanstalkd.domain.tld
            port: 11300
            timeout: 60
        secondary:
            server: beanstalkd-2.domain.tld
            default: true
            proxy: acme.pheanstalk
```

*acme.pheanstalk* is a custom proxy which implements the *Scribe\PheanstalkBundle\Proxy\PheanstalkProxyInterface* interface.

**Note:**
```
    You can retreive each pheanstalk using the container with "scribe.pheanstalk.[pheanstalk_name]".
    When you define a "default" pheanstalk. You can have a direct access to it with "scribe.pheanstalk".
```

``` php
<?php

namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

class HomeController extends Controller {

    public function indexAction() {
        $pheanstalkPrimary = $this->get("scribe.pheanstalk.primary");
        $pheanstalkSecondary = $this->get("scribe.pheanstalk");

        // ----------------------------------------
        // producer (queues jobs) on beanstalk.domain.tld

        $pheanstalkDefault
            ->useTube('testtube')
            ->put("job payload goes here\n");

        // ----------------------------------------
        // worker (performs jobs) on beanstalk-2.domain.tld

        $job = $pheanstalkSecondary
            ->watch('testtube')
            ->ignore('default')
            ->reserve();

        echo $job->getData();

        $pheanstalkSecondary->delete($job);

        // ----------------------------------------
        // on each defined pheanstalks
        $pheanstalkLocator = $this->get("scribe.pheanstalk.pheanstalk_locator");

        foreach($pheanstalkLocator->getPheanstalks() as $pheanstalk) {
            $pheanstalk
                ->useTube('boardcast')
                ->put("job payload goes here\n");
        }
    }

}
?>
